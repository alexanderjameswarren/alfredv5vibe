This is Alfred, a GTD-style task management app.

## When making database changes:
- Use Supabase CLI: `supabase migration new [name]`
- Edit migration file in `supabase/migrations/`
- Push with: `supabase db push`
- Always commit migration files

## Code conventions:
- Main app: `src/Alfred.jsx` 
- All state managed in main component
- Use existing storage adapter (handles DB conversion)
- Follow existing patterns for new features
