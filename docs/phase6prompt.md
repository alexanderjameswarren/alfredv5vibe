Read phase6-progress.md and identify the first step with status "⬜ Not Started".

Update that step to "🟡 In Progress" and update the Last Updated timestamp.

Then read phase6-implementation-steps.md and find the corresponding step number. Follow the requirements exactly.

IMPORTANT: For any database changes (SQL):
- Generate the complete SQL statements
- Format them as copy-paste ready
- DO NOT execute them yourself
- Present them to me to run in Supabase SQL Editor

For code changes:
- Implement in src/Alfred.jsx (or create new files if needed)
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Test locally

After implementation, tell me what to verify. I will test and confirm when it's working, then I'll update the step to "✅ Complete".
